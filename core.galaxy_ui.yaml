description: A gentle introduction to the Galaxy User Interface
title_default: "Welcome to Galaxy"

# This interactive Tour was modified by Mo Heydarian, with technical support and input from Enis Afgan and Mallory Freeberg, from the original version that is packaged within Galaxy (16.07).
# Additions:
# - To expand uability of this tour for demonstrations, there is a step at the end that takes the user back to the Galaxy home screen.
# - The data import was simplified to one file that produces an output with the default Filter settings. 
# - Minor typos and wording was enahnced. 


# A tour is made of several steps, each of them beginning with a dash '-'
steps:
    # 'title's will be displayed in the header of each step-container
    # If you don't specify any title, a default title is used, defined above.
    - title: "Welcome to Galaxy"
      # 'content' is the actual text that is shown to the user
      content: "This short tour will guide you through Galaxy's user interface.<br>
                You can navigate with your arrow keys and leave the tour at any point with 'Escape' or the 'End tour' button."
      # backdrop is just one of many properties you can attach to one step-container,
      # a full reference can be found at http://bootstraptour.com/api/
      backdrop: true


    # 'element' is the JQuery Selector (http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/) of the element you want to describe
    # In this case we want to highlight the Upload button with the `.upload-button` selector
